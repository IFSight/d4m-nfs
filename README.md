# d4m-nfs

With the Docker for Mac's (D4M) current implementation of osxfs, depending on how read and write heavy containers are on mounted volumes, performance can be abismal.

d4m-nfs blantently steals from the way that DockerRoot/xhyve used NFS mounts to get around i/o performance issues. With this implementation D4M appears to even outperform DockerRoot/xhyve under a full Drupal stack (mariadb/redis/php-fpm/nginx/varnish/haproxy).

The advantage of this over a file sync strategy is simpler, less overhead and not having to duplicate files.
